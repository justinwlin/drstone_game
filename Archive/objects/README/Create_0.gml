Ex. How to loop through the dictionary:
1) Grab the length of the sprite b/c the dictionary length is based on how many
sprites there are
2) Then you can just loop through it: 

ex. 
itemStorageNum = sprite_get_number(spr_itemStorage);
for(var i = 0; i < itemStorageNum; i++){
	itemAmountInStorage = global.storage[? i]
}
